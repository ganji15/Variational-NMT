## Differences

For Variational NMT, 
I did not use the mean-pooling for both sides (source and target).
I tested only using the last source hidden state is sufficient to achieve good performance.

For Variational Recurrent NMT, 
I tested only using the current RNN state is sufficient to achieve good performance.

explains the reason why use GRU instead of LSTM for building RNN cell, in general, VAE-LSTM-decoder performs worse than vanilla-LSTM-decoder.
